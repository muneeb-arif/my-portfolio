# Loading Sequence Test

## Expected Loading Sequence

When a user hits the URL, the following sequence should occur:

### 1. Initial Load (Settings Only)
- ✅ Settings load first via `SettingsProvider`
- ✅ Main loader shows "Loading your portfolio..."
- ✅ Settings include theme, banner name, avatar, etc.
- ✅ Main loader disappears when settings are ready

### 2. Lazy Loading (After Settings)
- ✅ Projects and categories load via `loadPortfolioData()`
- ✅ Technologies load via `Technologies` component
- ✅ Domains/Niche load via `DomainsNiche` component

## Console Logs to Verify

Look for these console logs in order:

1. `🌍 GLOBAL SETTINGS LOAD: Starting...`
2. `✅ GLOBAL SETTINGS LOAD: Complete!`
3. `🎯 SETTINGS READY: Main loader will disappear, starting lazy loading...`
4. `📊 LAZY LOADING: Starting to load projects and categories...`
5. `🔄 PROJECTS LOADING: Fetching projects and categories...`
6. `✅ PROJECTS LOADED: X projects, Y categories`
7. `🏁 PROJECTS LOADING: Complete`
8. `🎯 TECHNOLOGIES: Starting to load technologies...`
9. `✅ TECHNOLOGIES LOADED: X technologies`
10. `🏁 TECHNOLOGIES LOADING: Complete`
11. `🏆 DOMAINS/NICHE: Starting to load niches...`
12. `✅ DOMAINS/NICHE LOADED: X niches`
13. `🏁 DOMAINS/NICHE LOADING: Complete`

## How to Test

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Watch the console logs appear in sequence
5. Verify the main loader disappears after settings load
6. Verify individual sections show their own loading states

## Key Changes Made

1. **App.js**: Split into `AppWithSettings` wrapper and `AppContent` component
2. **Settings Loading**: Main loader now depends only on settings loading
3. **Lazy Loading**: Projects, technologies, and niche load after settings are ready
4. **Individual Loading States**: Each section has its own loading state
5. **Console Logging**: Added detailed logging to track the sequence

## Benefits

- ✅ Faster initial page load (only settings)
- ✅ Better user experience (main loader disappears quickly)
- ✅ Progressive loading of content
- ✅ Individual section loading states
- ✅ Better performance and perceived speed
