# Portfolio Owner Configuration
# Set this to the email of the user whose data should be displayed on the public portfolio
# This should match an email that exists in your Supabase authentication
REACT_APP_PORTFOLIO_OWNER_EMAIL=your-email@example.com

# How it works:
# - If a user is authenticated (dashboard mode), their data will be shown
# - If no user is authenticated (public mode), the portfolio owner's data will be shown
# - If no owner email is set, fallback data will be used
